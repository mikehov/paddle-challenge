                    we are basically connecting with our nature. While surfing you will discover a new parts off life
                    you have probably not experienced before,
                    discovering new muscles you didn’t know you had, finding out new skills and techniques,
                    maybe even making some new friends along the way.

                            As most people know, surfing ain't easy.
                            Surfing can also to be considered, quite painful and even a little dangerous.
                            You will learn to sometimes face your fears,
                            believe in yourself and go for it. As Roy T. Bennett once said:
                            "The one who falls and gets up is stronger than the one who never tried, do not fear failure
                            but rather fear not trying."
                            The longer you surf, the more confidence you will build,
                            that's a beautiful skill we need life that will makes us,
                            the better version of ourselves.

                            Sometimes we forget how beautiful our mother earth actually is,
                            you will look at our nature at ways you have maybe never looked at before.
                            The beautiful waves, the lovely birds in the sky,
                            it makes us think twice about respecting our earth.
                            Nature will make us feel connected where we can be our selves,
                            doesn't matter who we are or where we come from.

                            Doesn't matter if know you them, you will both enjoy the waves
                            and maybe have little talk and maybe even share a little drink in the end.

                            norms and values that enjoy hitting a wave from time to time.
