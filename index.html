                <h1>Why start surfing?</h1>
                <p class="text-white">Surfing isn't just a fun outdoor activity, 
                    it can also do wonders for your physical and mental wellbeing. By helping to release stress and tension, 
                    it provides a calming escape from everyday reality and a chance to connect with nature. When you surf, you'll 
                    discover new aspects of life, from previously unknown muscles to fresh skills and techniques. 
                    Plus, you might even make new friends along the way. While surfing can be challenging, 
                    it's a journey of improvement that leads to great rewards. And if you're not convinced yet, that's okay, 
                    surfing isn't for everyone. But if you're up for some fun and all the benefits that come with it, why not give it a try?

                        <p>
                            Surfing offers numerous physical benefits, provided it is done correctly. 
                            As a full-body workout, surfing engages muscles in ways you may not have realized. 
                            Core muscles, including those in your arms, shoulders, chest, back, and legs, are specifically targeted.
                            Additionally, surfing and paddling can build strength, while also improving your balance, stamina, flexibility, 
                            and lung capacity. It's no exaggeration to say that surfing is a true workout that can benefit your overall physical health.

                        <span class="blue-line"></span>
                        <p>
                            In addition to the physical benefits, surfing also offers mental benefits. Despite being a strenuous workout, 
                            surfing can be incredibly calming and relieving. It provides an escape from work and other struggles, allowing you to fully 
                            immerse yourself in the experience of being in nature and enjoying yourself. 
                            Simply watching the waves hitting the shore can be a relaxing activity, so just let yourself go with the flow!

                            Surfing is a challenging sport that comes with its fair share of difficulties. 
                            It can be painful and even risky at times. However, it also provides an opportunity to confront our fears, 
                            believe in ourselves, and take action. As Roy T. Bennett wisely stated, 
                            "The one who falls and gets up is stronger than the one who never tried, do not fear failure but rather fear not trying." 
                            <span class="quote">Bennett (2020)</span> As you progress in your surfing journey, you'll gain confidence, 
                            a valuable skill that can translate to other areas of your life and help you become the best version of yourself.

                            We often forget the true beauty of Mother Earth, 
                            but surfing provides a unique perspective to appreciate nature in ways we may have never seen before. 
                            From the graceful waves to the serene birds soaring above, we're reminded to respect and care for our planet. 
                            Connecting with nature through surfing allows us to feel a sense of belonging and authenticity, regardless of our background or identity.

                            Surfing is an activity that can be enjoyed alone or with friends, but more often than not, you will encounter other surfers. 
                            It doesn't matter if you're familiar with them or not, you'll both share a love for catching waves and perhaps exchange some small talk, 
                            or even share a drink afterwards. 
                            These are people with diverse lives, beliefs, norms, and values, who all find joy in riding the waves from time to time.
